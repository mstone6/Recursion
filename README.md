# Recursion
#Sum of Digits:

#Write a recursive function to find the sum of the digits of a positive integer. For example, the sum of the digits in an array of {1,2,3,4,5} would be  (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 #+ 5) = 15

 

#Counting Down:

#Write a recursive function that counts down from a given number to 1. For example, if you start with 5, the function should print: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

 

#Reverse a String:

#Write a recursive function to reverse a given string. For example, if you have the string "hello," the function should return "olleh."
